Below are your JavaScript challenges for the week.

IF-STATEMENT 
1. Write an if-statement that checks if a number is positive and prints "Positive number" if true.

2. Create an if-statement that determines if a given string has more than 10 characters and prints "Long string" if true.

3. Implement an if-statement that checks if a user's age is above 18 and prints "You are an adult" if true.

4. Develop an if-statement that checks if a given number is divisible by 5 and prints "Divisible by 5" if true.

5. Write an if-statement that checks if a user's input is equal to the word "password" and prints "Access granted" if true.

IF-ELSE-STATEMENT

1. Write an if-else statement that checks if a number is positive. If true, print "Positive number", otherwise print "Non-positive number".

2. Create an if-else statement that determines if a given string has more than 10 characters. If true, print "Long string", otherwise print "Short string".

3. Implement an if-else statement that checks if a user's age is above 18. If true, print "You are an adult", otherwise print "You are a minor".

4. Develop an if-else statement that checks if a given number is divisible by 5. If true, print "Divisible by 5", otherwise print "Not divisible by 5".

5. Write an if-else statement that checks if a user's input is equal to the word "password". If true, print "Access granted", otherwise print "Access denied".


IF-ELSE-IF
1. *Traffic Light Simulator:*
   Simulate a traffic light system using JavaScript. Print messages indicating which color the traffic light is displaying based on a given condition. For example:
   - If the condition is "red," print "Stop."
   - If the condition is "green," print "Go."
   - If the condition is "yellow," print "Proceed with caution."

2. *Temperature Classifier:*
   Classify temperatures into different categories based on the value provided:
   - If the temperature is below 0, print "Freezing."
   - If the temperature is between 0 and 15, print "Cold."
   - If the temperature is between 16 and 25, print "Mild."
   - If the temperature is above 25, print "Hot."

3. *Day of the Week Checker:*
   Check and print a message indicating whether a given day is a weekday or a weekend day:
   - If the day is Monday to Friday, print "Weekday."
   - If the day is Saturday or Sunday, print "Weekend."

4. *Grading System:*
   Write a JavaScript program that takes a numerical grade as input and print the corresponding letter grade based on the following criteria:
   - A: 90-100
   - B: 80-89
   - C: 70-79
   - D: 60-69
   - F: Below 60

5. *Time of Day Greeting:*
   Create a JavaScript program that takes the current hour as input and print a greeting message based on the time of day:
   - Before 12 PM: Good morning
   - Between 12 PM and 5 PM: Good afternoon
   - After 5 PM: Good evening

   LOOP, ARRAY, OBJECT, CONDITIONAL EXECUTION 

1. *Shopping List Total Calculator:*
   Create a JavaScript program that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping list. The program should iterate through an array of objects, where each object represents an item with properties for name and price. Use an if-else if statement to determine if an item has a discount based on its price. Finally, compute the total cost and print it.

2. *Student Grades Analyzer:*
   Write a JavaScript program that analyzes an array of student objects. Each student object should have properties for name and grades (an array of numbers). Calculate and print the average grade for each student using a loop and an if-else statement to handle cases where a student has no grades.
